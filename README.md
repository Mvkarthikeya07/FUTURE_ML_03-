🚀 Project Overview

This project is an ATS-style Resume / Candidate Screening and Ranking System that evaluates single or multiple resumes against a given job description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The system assigns an explainable ATS score to each candidate and automatically ranks candidates based on their suitability for the job role.

🔍 Workflow

Upload one or multiple resumes (PDF / DOCX / TXT)

Parse and clean resume text using NLP

Extract relevant technical skills

Match skills with job requirements

Compute a semantic similarity score

Calculate skill coverage and identify skill gaps

Generate a final weighted ATS score

Rank candidates automatically based on the final score

This closely simulates real-world recruitment and HR analytics platforms.

🧠 Scoring Methodology (Industry-Level & Explainable)

The system uses a two-layer evaluation approach:

1️⃣ Semantic Match Score

TF-IDF Vectorization

Cosine Similarity

Measures contextual alignment between resume content and job description

2️⃣ Skill Coverage Score

Calculated strictly using job-required skills

Prevents inflated or misleading scores

🔥 Final ATS Score
Final ATS Score = (0.6 × Semantic Match) + (0.4 × Skill Coverage)


This ensures fair, transparent, and explainable candidate evaluation.

🏆 Candidate Ranking Logic

Each resume receives a Final ATS Score

Candidates are sorted in descending order

The system produces an explicit ranking:

Rank 1 → Highest suitability
Rank 2 → Moderate suitability
Rank 3 → Low suitability


This satisfies the “candidate ranking based on role fit” requirement of Task 3.

🧪 Testing & Ranking Demonstration

To validate correctness, explainability, and ranking behavior, three controlled resumes were evaluated together:

🟢 Strong Resume

High skill coverage (≈100%)

Moderate semantic alignment

Ranked 1st with the highest Final ATS Score

🟡 Medium Resume

Partial skill match

Moderate semantic similarity

Ranked 2nd

🔴 Weak Resume

Low skill relevance

Multiple missing required skills

Ranked 3rd (last) with a very low score

This clearly demonstrates accurate discrimination and ranking, a core ATS requirement.
